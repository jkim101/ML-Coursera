What Is Machine Learning?
  - Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Supervised Learning 
  - Regression: predict results within a continuous output
  - Classification: map input variables into discrete categories
