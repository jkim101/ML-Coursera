**Linear Regression with one variable**

Model and Cost Function
- Supervised Learning: Given the "right answer" for each example in the data
- Unsupervised Learning: Predict real-valued output

Model Representation
- A pair of input variable and target variable is called a 'training example'. A list of training examples is called a 'training set'.

'Hypothesis' <-- Call this for historical reason, not fit on ML (Andrew said).

Types of Problems
>Predict continuous things... call the learning problem a 'regression problem'.
>Predict (a smally number of) discrete values of y, it could be a 'classification problem'.

Linear Regression with one variable = Univariate linear regression

Cost Function
Idea: Choose \theta 0, \theta 1 so that h(x) is close to y for our training examples (x, y)

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$
