What Is Machine Learning?
  - Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Supervised Learning 
  - Regression: predict results within a continuous output
  - Classification: map input variables into discrete categories

Unsupervised Learning
  - Clustering (algorithm)
    . Google New: BP Oil Spill
    . Gene expression
    . Organizing computing clusters
    . Social Network analysis
    . Market segmentation
    . AStronomical data analysis
  - Non-clustering 
  - Distinguish voices in Cocktail party problem
    . Algorithm: [W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x. *x, 1), size(x,1),1).*x)*x');
      svd - singular value decomposition
  - Implementation: Octav or Matlab
